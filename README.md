## N.B: Things That I Didn't Cover

1. **Recommendation (You might also like)**: This feature is not available because the API to get products in the same category is not working, returning a 500 error.
2. **Store Profile Images**: The store profile images are the same for all stores because the images are randomly generated in the API.
